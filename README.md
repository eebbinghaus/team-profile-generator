# Team Profile Generator

## Description

Use this Team Profile Generator to quickly generate a webpage that will display your team's basic information. This will give you quick access to their email address and GitHub profiles. Answer a few questions about your team and an HTML file will be generated that will display a nicely formatted team roster. When you click on one of the team members email addresses it will automatically launch your default email program and will populate the To: field making sending emails quick and easy. Like wise, clicking on a team members GitHub username will take you directly to their corresponding GitHub profile.
